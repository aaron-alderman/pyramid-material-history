# The Missing Middle

**Physics to archaeology through the pyramids.**

A pyramid is a meeting of worlds: electronic states, bonds, mineral structure, chemical processes, rock, landscape, human work and surviving evidence. This corpus follows the mechanisms that connect those descriptions and the missing information between them.

The pyramids are the canonical example. Khufu's Great Pyramid is the first named anchor. Granite–alkali treatment is one candidate investigation within that larger material history.

## What is here

The next layer is populated: [six worked investigations](https://aaron-alderman.github.io/pyramid-material-history/studies/) cover material identity, granite–alkali feasibility, archaeological discrimination, variation analysis a primary-source sample audit and useful-removal analysis. They contain thirty-eight atomic research steps, sixteen additional source records and sixteen reproducible calculation/transcription views. These are desk investigations using source-reported observations and explicit scenarios; no new physical experiment or monument sampling was performed.

Start with [the canonical investigation records](corpus/worked-investigations.json), [calculation inputs](corpus/calculation-inputs.json) and [the numerical adapter](scripts/worked-calculations.mjs). The build publishes every calculation, its assumptions and the retained composer's quantity-dimension checks. Source access limits are visible on individual source pages. Proposed controls and unmeasured rates retain their scope.

[Vary the factors. Find the bottleneck.](https://aaron-alderman.github.io/pyramid-material-history/studies/W04/) demonstrates conditional factorial contrasts, an interaction diagnostic, a depth–flux sensitivity grid, bottleneck transfer and whole-project cost leverage. Assigned responses and stage times are visibly synthetic; there are no fitted granite effects, reconstructed ancient productivity, statistical significance claims or historical promotion.

[The Lauer sample audit](https://aaron-alderman.github.io/pyramid-material-history/studies/W05/) follows competing scientific interpretations, reported fragment identity and five printed SEM–EDS entries. It reproduces a located numerical contrast while preserving source attribution, missing uncertainty and chronology. [Evidence coverage](https://aaron-alderman.github.io/pyramid-material-history/coverage/) separates observations, measured inputs, models, proposed discriminators and gaps for all 26 declared bridges. Eight receive a focused assessment in this increment; unreviewed entries are not claims of absent evidence.

The corpus contains nine operation families, seventeen domain stations, twenty-six candidate bridges, seven pyramid investigations, negative constraints, retained unknowns and source references. The operation families provide the scoped MECE partition. Disciplines remain overlapping annotations.

The route passes through quantum models, orbitals, bonds, Bloch and Wannier representations, lattices and defects, chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, coupled material processes, geology, geophysics, manufacture, preservation and archaeological inference.

Attention motivates the example. Evidence determines the conclusions. A mathematical relation, a feasible process and an established historical occurrence carry different authority.

## Reused machinery

This repository uses the existing Claimipedia/Sourcery twelve-coordinate kernel, common-algebra interpreter and scientific record composer, surface-composition contract, native lowering, component library, native adoption and grammar-driven collection controls. The static Pages workflow follows the existing corpus and Halloween Monster Hunt publications.

[REUSE.md](REUSE.md) identifies the owners and boundaries. [data/reuse-lock.json](data/reuse-lock.json) binds retained source bytes and the explicit serializer extraction. No new Sourcery lane, runtime, scheduler or authority registry is introduced.

The research source originated in [Spin(2,3) Relational Geometry](https://github.com/aaron-alderman/spin23-relational-geometry). This repository owns the standalone material-history corpus and its presentation. Upstream results retain their cited scope and authority.

## Build and inspect

Node.js 22 or later is sufficient. Retained dependencies are included; no dependency installation is required.

```text
node scripts/build.mjs
node --test scripts/qualification.test.mjs
node scripts/serve.mjs
```

Open the printed local URL. `_site/` is a disposable reading projection. Canonical research lives in `corpus/`; presentation declarations live in `data/publication.json`. The build produces per-page composition and native-lowering receipts, native adoption records, the semantic decomposition and the common-algebra composition/refusal result.

GitHub Actions rebuilds and qualifies the publication before deploying it to GitHub Pages.

## Licenses

Research and documentation are CC BY-SA 4.0. Software is GPL-3.0-or-later; identified third-party material retains its own terms. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

[From selective reaction to useful removal](https://aaron-alderman.github.io/pyramid-material-history/studies/W06/) preserves published high-pressure granite rates and normalized residue compositions. Its conditional conversions expose geometry and denominator assumptions. [Source records](corpus/removal-evidence.json) retain units, precision, source hashes and missing data. No atmospheric shaping rate, archaeological attribution or building-cost/CO₂ saving is inferred.
